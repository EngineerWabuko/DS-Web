		It's surprisingly hard to nail down Data Science, especially given how ubiquitous the term has
		become. Vocal critics have variously dismissed the term as a superfluous label (after all, what science
		doesn’t involve data?)
		In my mind, these critiques miss something important. Data science, despite its hype-laden veneer, is
		perhaps the best label we have for the cross-disciplinary set of skills that are becoming increasingly
		important in many applications across industry and academia.I think people mean when they say “data science”: it is fundamentally an interdisciplinary subject. Data
		science comprises three distinct and 	overlapping areas: the skills of a statistician who knows how to
		model and summarize datasets (which are growing ever larger); the skills of a computer scientist who
		can design and use algorithms to efficiently store, process, and visualize this data; and the domain
		expertise — what we might think of as “classical” training in a subject — necessary both to formulate the
		right questions and to put their answers in context.
		With this in mind,<strong> I would encourage you to think of data science not as a new domain of knowledge to
		learn, but as a new set of skills that you can apply within your current area of expertise</strong>. Whether you are
		<i>reporting election results, forecasting stock returns, optimizing online ad clicks, identifying
		microorganisms in microscope photos, seeking new classes of astronomical objects, or working with data
		in any other field</i>, the goal of this blog is to give you the ability to ask and answer new questions about
		your chosen subject area.

		<h2 id="flex"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: 25px;">Role of Data Science and fields where Applied</strong><br><br>
			Data Science is  playing a very great role, <strong>where data is involved you can't fail to find the importance of DS.</strong>
			DS helps in Data analysis in great companies where huge data is involved by visualizing the data into something imagery that can be easily understood, by tabling and grouping the data into readable format. DS helps in prediction of what may happen next e.g prediction of who may win the elections, the following day's weather, population of people in years to come etc. Meaning DS can be used in Hospitals, Politics, Banks, Network Companies (Safaricom, Airtel, Telkom), Schools, Census etc

	<div id="role_app_adv">
		<h2 id="flex"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: 25px;">Fields that Data Science is Holding</strong><br><br>
			DS helps in <strong>Machine Learning</strong> by storing data in an easy and readable manner for easy <i>manipulation</i> by machines.
			In <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> too, DS holds a greater position of dealing with large amounts of Data in the AI field.
			<strong>Data Structures</strong> is another important field in Computer Science that needs <i>data tabling</i> for easy reading and calculation of large amounts of data.
			<strong>Algorithms</strong> too are a bit dependant on DS because of a well <i>organized data</i> making work easier for readers and users.

	<div id="role_app_adv">
		<h2 id="flex"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: 25px;">Advantages of Data Science</strong><br><br>
			DS has <strong>Pandas</strong> that help in <i>Manipulation of Tabled or columned data.</i>
			Use of <strong>Matplotlibs</strong> that helps in <i>data Visualization</i> into graphs, pie charts, and more forms that can be read by view of diagrams.
			<strong>Numpys</strong> help in <i>dense data Arrays manipulation</i> into something easy to understand and read at the same time.
			<strong>Scikit-Learn</strong> module also plays a great role in DS in that it majorly deals with <i>Machine Learning.</i>
			DS has a lot of modules apart from the ones explained above such as <strong><i>Scipy, Keras, Tensorflow, Pytorch, Beautiful Soup</i></strong> etc.
